# Sown: A Seed Saver's App

An app made for all those seed collectors out there who anxiously await each seasonal harvest!

## Summary

This was my very first exploration into the world of React. Since I am an avid gardener, I immediately was struck by the idea of a simply way for users to store seed and growth information. This project was a culmination of six months of hard work in the front end portion of our year-long software engineering bootcamp.

## Future Goal

- I would love to eventually add more features such as weather predictions, soil preferences for the area of the country the user lives in, and a way to communicate the user where the seeds they are running low on are being sold in their area.

## Thank You

I would love to thank Lynn Samuelson, Sydney Noh, and Trevor Guinn for continuously offering their time, support, and wisdom throughout the journey our class has taken through front end development.
